AWS CLI

export AWS_PROFILE=dkm // Specify aws profile for the current terminal session
aws s3 ls s3:://my-bucket --profile dkm // Specify profile for one command


aws s3 ls s3://my-bucket

aws s3 cp s3://my-bucket/.myfile ./ // copy file to current dir


aws s3 sync ./ s3://my-bucket // sync but don't delete files which were removed in one location
aws s3 sync ./ s3://my-bucket --delete // DO delete those files



aws s3 rm s3://dkm-aws-general-storage --recursive // empty a bucket

aws s3 mb s3://my-bucket // makes bucket (with fairly public settings by default) 

-- Buckets are made in us-east-1 by default (from the cli) so I have to specify my region:
aws s3 mb s3://my-bucket --region us-east-2 

aws s3 rb s3://my-bucket // removes bucket

// To make a temporary link to share...(60 = 60 sec, default is one hour)
aws s3 presign s3://dkm-aws-general-storage/race1.csv --expires-in 60 --region us-east-2

-- Specifying the region seems to be a consequence of not using the 'default' aws profile. Since I go back and forth between two accounts, might be easiest to rename the one I am using as default (in ~/.aws/config and ~/.aws/credentials
