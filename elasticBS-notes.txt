Elastic Beanstalk / RDS notes

Test the ability to connect to remote RDS db from the command line with:

nc -zv <rds db endpoint> <port>
nc -zv fake-jurors.cjq6dzefzwe3.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com 3306

Prep Laravel app for deploy to EBS with:
zip ../jurorApp.zip -r * .[^.]* -x "vendor/*"

If you can't connect from local SQL app (such as Sequel Pro) to remote RDS database, add an inbound rule to the DB security group allowing TCP traffic from your IP

Juror RDS endpoint: fake-jurors.cjq6dzefzwe3.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com
Port: 3306
