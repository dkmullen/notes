Laraval notes

laravel new <app name>
php artisan serve
php artisan make:controller PostsController

sudo mysql -u root -p (logs me in)ÃŸ
mysql -u dkm


-- Start and Stop XAMPP servers ---
sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start
sudo /opt/lampp/lampp stop

-- Start XAMPP Graphical Tool for managing servers --
cd /opt/lampp
sudo ./manager-linux-x64.run

--- Artisan ---
php artisan  - provides a list of artisan commands


-- Migrations (under 'database' in the code) --
php artisan make:migration create_posts_table (Convention: create_<table-name>_table)
php artisan migrate
php artisan migrate:rollback
php artisan migrate:fresh

--- After cloning a repo ---
php composer.phar install - to install dependencies; and if it fails...
composer install - worked on MAC

php -r "readfile('https://getcomposer.org/installer');" | php 
...moved composer.phar to /usr/local/bin so it should run globally

php artisan tinker
--- Adding a record ---
$assignment = new App\Models\Assignment;
$assignment->body = 'Finish school work';
$assignment->save();

--- Retrieving (in tinker) ---
App\Models\Assignment::all();
App\Models\Assignment::first();
App\Models\Assignment::where('completed', false)->get();

$meAssignment = App\Models\Assignment::first();
$meAssignment->uncomplete(); (Calls a method in the business logic of our Assignment Model)
--- :: and -> are ways of calling a method - not clear on the reason for each ---

@extends ('layout')
@section ('content')
{{ $post }}
@endsection

...and in the layout view...
@yield ('content')

--- Actively compiling scss, js from the resources dir to public ---
* Install with npm install, run with npm run watch (compiles on save)

--- Variations on fetching from a list of articles ---
    $article = App\Models\Article::all();
    $article = App\Models\Article::take(2)->get();
    $article = App\Models\Article::paginate(2);
    // Shorthand for the latest 'created_at' but you can sort by any timestamp
    $article = App\Models\Article::latest()->get();
$article = App\Models\Article::take(3)->latest()->get();

--- Seven restful controller actions ---
- index - to LIST some records - ie, getAll
- show - to SHOW ONE - ie, getOne
- create - to make one
- store - to persist or store one - POST 
- edit - to change the resource...
- update - ....and to persist or store the updated one
- destroy

Here's the MAGIC: Use...
php artisan make:controller ProjectsController -r -m MyProject
Makes a controller and model, fills in all seven of the above actions and calls my model (MyProject) as an argument!

GET /articles
GET /articles/:id
POST /articles
PUT /articles/:id
DELETE /articles/:id


---

Make use of the user factory built in to laravel apps to generate fake users:
php artisan tinker
User::factory()->count(4)->create();
User::factory()->create();

Make a new factory:
php artisan make:factory ArticleFactory


--- Authentication
-- setup -- adds auth scaffolding under views, and an auth route under routes.
-- this example specifies vue as a framework; could be bootstrap or react also
laravel new authapp
composer require laravel/ui --dev
php artisan ui vue --auth
npm install && npm run dev

php artisan route:list (shows all routes for the project)
Make a db in phpmyadmin
php artisan migrate (to transfer all the newly created stuff - had to change port to 3307 to make this work)

Auth middleware are called in the controller(s). More common to chain routes in the routes file 

// To display different greetings for signed in /not signed in users...
@if (Auth::check())
    Hi, {{ Auth::user()->name }}
@else
    Sign in
@endif

or a more laravel way...(see preset examples in welcome blade)
@auth
    Hi, {{ Auth::user()->name }}
@else
    Sign in
@endauth

And here is the opposite
@guest
   Please sign in
@else
     Hi, {{ Auth::user()->name }}
@endguest

For the 'forgot pw' lesson, changed mail mailer (in env) to 'log' and the pw reset email came to laravel.log

Deleting in laravel:

    public function destroyGrandJuryDate($id)
    {
        $date = GrandJuryDates::where('id', $id);
        $date->delete();
    }

Date format
date("F d, Y") = April 13, 2021 (matches grand jury date format)
