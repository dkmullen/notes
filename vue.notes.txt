# Vue Notes

### Getting Started

Starter project at [https://github.com/dkmullen/vue-starter](https://github.com/dkmullen/vue-starter)

Or:
- `vue create my-project`
- `cd` into project
- `vue add vuetify`

**Probable dependencies**
- `npm install --save vue-router vuex axios`

Be sure app is wrapped in `<v-app></v-app>` tags or vuetify won't work. On initial install, these are in the main component (`App.vue`), which is where I like to put my `<router-view></router-view>`
